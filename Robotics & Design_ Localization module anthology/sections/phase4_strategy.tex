\subsection{Strategy}

The main objective of this final phase was to \textbf{prepare the robot for presentation and demonstration}, ensuring that the system was functional, understandable, and representative of the work carried out throughout the project.

We began by \textbf{defining a clear list of deliverables}, which included:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A working prototype of the movement module with integrated electronics and basic behaviors
    \item A clean and secure physical assembly, including internal wiring, battery placement, and sensor positioning
    \item A stable version of the control code capable of switching between manual and autonomous modes
    \item Visual and written documentation to support the explanation of the design and development process
\end{itemize}

To organize the work, we split tasks across the team, focusing on:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Final code polishing and debugging
    \item Mechanical adjustments and reinforcement of the structure
    \item Aesthetic finishing touches to the robot's appearance
    \item Preparation of media and presentation material (images, diagrams, video, report)
\end{itemize}

This strategic approach allowed us to arrive at a functional and communicative prototype, aligned with the original goals and suitable for public demonstration and evaluation.
