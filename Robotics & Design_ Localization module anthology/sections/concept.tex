\subsection{Concept}

The concept behind our robot is to create a social and functional assistant that organizes the use of a shared microwave in a university environment.

By dispensing turn tickets and patrolling the space autonomously, the robot aims to bring order to an otherwise chaotic or informal process, while adding an element of humor and engagement through its unique design.

Inspired by everyday kitchen objects, its cooking pot-like appearance makes the robot immediately relatable and non-intimidating, encouraging students to approach it easily. Its ability to move, pause, and react transforms a mundane waiting experience into a playful and organized interaction, promoting better coexistence in shared spaces.

The combination of functionality and personality defines the essence of this project:

\textbf{a robot that not only helps manage tasks but also becomes a memorable part of its environment.}
