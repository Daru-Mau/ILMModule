\section{Phase 1: Discover}

During the discovery phase, the team organized its structure, established roles for management, conducted research and developed initial proposals for the module.

\subsection{Team Organization}

Our team is composed of five students:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ermelinda Giulivo}

\subsection{Research}

The research phase is a critical foundation for the development of the movement and localization module of the indoor robot. At this stage, the primary objective is to explore and analyse existing technologies, methodologies and systems that enable precise navigation and positioning within indoor environments. Unlike outdoor settings, indoor environments present unique challenges such as signal attenuation, dynamic obstacles and limited access to GPS, making robust and reliable localization and movement a complex task.
