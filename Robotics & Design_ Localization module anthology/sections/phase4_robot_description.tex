\subsection{Final Robot Description}

Our final robot represents the culmination of our design, development, and integration efforts throughout this project. The movement module serves as the foundation for a social robot designed to manage access to microwaves in a university environment. The completed robot successfully integrates technical functionality with an engaging aesthetic that invites human interaction.

The robot combines multiple modules working in harmony:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A robust \textbf{movement platform} with omnidirectional capability
    \item An \textbf{obstacle detection system} using ultrasonic sensors
    \item A visually distinctive \textbf{cloud-like base} with embedded LED lighting
    \item A \textbf{transparent ticket dispensing system} as its core interactive element
    \item A character-driven \textbf{design language} that creates a friendly and approachable presence
\end{itemize}

The final robot achieves its primary design goals of being functional, modular, and socially engaging while maintaining a compact and maneuverable form factor suitable for navigating university spaces.
