\subsection{Mechanics}

The final mechanical structure of the robot is composed of \textbf{two dodecagonal wooden platforms}: a \textbf{base platform} and an \textbf{upper platform}, connected by four vertical wooden columns. This simplified configuration was adopted after removing the initially planned intermediate layer, which had interfered with wheel clearance.

The \textbf{base platform} is the core of the system and holds \textbf{all the critical mechanical and electronic components}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item On the \textbf{underside}, we mounted the \textbf{three DC motors}, each connected to a \textbf{58 mm omnidirectional wheel} in a triangular layout to enable holonomic movement. The \textbf{motor drivers} are also fixed on this side, close to the motors, to reduce wiring length and improve accessibility.
    \item On the \textbf{upper side} of the same platform, we installed the \textbf{microcontroller}, \textbf{sensor wiring}, \textbf{power distribution boards}, and the \textbf{battery}. A vertical plastic panel helps organize the electronics, and the ultrasonic sensors are positioned around the base perimeter on alternating sides.
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{upper platform} is structurally intended to support \textbf{other modules}, such as the ticket dispenser or user interface components. It is fixed to the columns and aligned with the base to maintain symmetry and provide vertical expansion space.

All mechanical parts were fabricated using MDF panels and wooden supports, based on our technical drawings and 3D model. The final structure provides a \textbf{stable, modular, and compact skeleton} for the movement module, optimized for both functionality and future adaptability.

\subsubsection{Movement System}

The triangular configuration of the three omnidirectional wheels provides several key advantages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Holonomic movement}: The robot can move in any direction and rotate in place without needing to change orientation first
    
    \item \textbf{Simplified control}: With three wheels at 120Â° intervals, the inverse kinematics calculations become more straightforward
    
    \item \textbf{Mechanical stability}: The weight distribution across three points provides good balance while minimizing the number of components
    
    \item \textbf{Improved maneuverability}: The design allows for efficient navigation in tight spaces, crucial for the robot's intended environment
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Structural Adaptations}

During assembly and testing, we made several mechanical adaptations to optimize performance:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Removal of lower platform}: To increase wheel clearance and improve movement reliability
    
    \item \textbf{Addition of cotton padding}: For both aesthetic effect and to protect internal components
    
    \item \textbf{Reinforcement of column connections}: To ensure rigidity during rapid movements and direction changes
    
    \item \textbf{Redistribution of component weights}: For better balance and stability during rotation
\end{itemize}

These mechanical features come together to create a reliable platform that successfully fulfills the movement requirements of our social robot design.
