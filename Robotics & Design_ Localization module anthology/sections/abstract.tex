\section*{Abstract}

This project presents the design, development, and implementation of the movement module for a mobile social robot intended to manage access to microwaves in a university environment. The goal was to create a compact, autonomous platform capable of omnidirectional navigation, basic obstacle detection, and integration with future functional modules.

The mechanical structure consists of cut wooden platforms joined by vertical columns, housing all electronic and mechanical components. Movement is enabled by three DC motors with omnidirectional wheels, arranged in a triangular configuration, and controlled by motor drivers. A microcontroller governs the system, handling PWM motor control and ultrasonic sensor input, powered by a regulated LiPo battery setup.

The development process focused on early testing of individual components through a modular setup, followed by full system integration on the final chassis. The resulting prototype delivers a robust and adaptable movement platform, capable of supporting higher-level behaviors and other modules. It provides a solid foundation for building a functional and socially engaging service robot.
