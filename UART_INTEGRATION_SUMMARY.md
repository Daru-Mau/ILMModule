# UART Integration Summary

## Changes Made

1. Updated `apriltag_recognition.py` to use UART communication:

   - Replaced import of `raspy_communication` with `uart_communication`
   - Updated `setup_serial()` function to use `UARTCommunicator`
   - Updated direction codes to use constants from `uart_communication`
   - Added `get_direction_name` for better code readability
   - Fixed indentation issues

2. Created launcher scripts for easy system operation:

   - `launch_apriltag_uart.py` - Main launcher for AprilTag recognition with UART
   - `launch_apriltag_controller.py` - Launcher for the alternative controller

3. Created documentation:
   - `APRILTAG_UART_README.md` - README file explaining the integration

4. Enhanced smooth deceleration system:

   - Added global direction tracking variables in `integrated_movement.ino`
   - Implemented proper extern declarations in `smooth_deceleration.ino`
   - Improved direction preservation during deceleration
   - Fixed undefined reference errors in direction tracking
   - Ensured proper coordination between movement and deceleration systems

## Benefits of UART Communication

The UART communication module provides several advantages:

- Message framing with start/end markers
- Reliable command acknowledgment
- Auto-detection of Arduino ports
- Standardized numeric direction codes
- Enhanced error handling
- Direct motor control capability
- Sensor data retrieval

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Test the integrated system with Arduino hardware
2. **Optimization**: Fine-tune parameters for reliable detection and movement
3. **Advanced Features**: Implement additional features like sensor-based obstacle avoidance

## Usage

Use the launcher scripts for easy operation:

```bash
# Launch with default settings
python launch_apriltag_uart.py

# Launch with custom settings
python launch_apriltag_uart.py --max-speed 200 --min-speed 120 --verbose
```
